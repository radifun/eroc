# Eroc

Eroc is a collection of libraries to extend the capability of the Rust standard library.
Unlike the common practice in Rust world where each library provides a few certain features, Eroc follows the (somewhat outdated and undesirable) way by providing an extensive and high quality collection of functionalities all in one place.

> **Warning**:
> Eroc is still in a very early stage.
> Most of its features are not present, incomplete, untested and subject to significant change.
> It is strongly advised **NOT** to use the library for any purposes other than for having fun.

## Libraries

Eroc consists of the following libraries:

- `io`: an alternative to `std::io` module with `no_std` support.

## How to contribute

Contributions to Eroc are more than welcome.
However as the project is in a very early stage, it often does not have clear objectives and road map, which might lead to the inability to accept and absorb strong and fast-pace contribution.
To avoid any unnecessary disappointment, it is highly recommended to discuss with the author first before any attempt to contribute to Eroc code base is made.
